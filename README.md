# Hypot_CharArray
Algorithm that draws a line between any given two points in a 2-dimensional char array implemented by the "Strategy" design pattern.

The idea behind this is not just to draw a line between two points, but to imitate the line of sight of one point (or player) and to determine whether the object is in its line of sight.
